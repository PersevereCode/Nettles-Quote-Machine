# Quotes?

## J. Harrison Nettles

### Random Quote Machine

*This project was just a helpful tool to help me better understand and put into practice what I've learned as a developer to date. While much improvement is still needed, I think it's worth noting that I've come a substantial way in a relatively short period of time.

* I would like to be able to launce this applications so that users can add their own quotes.
* I'd also like for users to be able to share their favorite quotes on social media or to allow Ms. Baker to share her favorite quotes with the class.
* This project was a collaboration between myself and Mr. Butera
